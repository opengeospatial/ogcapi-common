== Requirements Class "Filtering Collections with CQL2"
:sectnums:

include::requirements/requirements_class_filtering.adoc[]

This Requirements Class describes query parameters that can be used to discover and select collections exposed through an OGC Web API, by using an OGC Common Query Language filter expression.

[[filtering-overview]]
=== Overview

This "Filtering Collections with CQL2" defines query parameters which can be used with the `/collections` endpoint (described in the https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#rc-collections-section[Collections Requirements Class of OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data])
to select which collections to return on a GET request:

* <<filtering-filter-parameter,filter>>: The expression used as a filter
* <<filtering-filter-lang-parameter,filter-lang>>: The language used to experss the filter (e.g., CQL2-JSON or CQL2-Text)

If implementing https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html[OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core] "Landing Page", these supported query parameters need to be described in the API definition as described in that part.

=== OGC API - Records compliance

This "Filtering Collections with CQL2" requirement class is consistent with the requirements of https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-004.html#clause-local-resources-catalog_filtering[OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core "Local Resources Catalog - Filtering" (Deployment)].
An implementation may gain additional interoperability by conforming to that requirement class from OGC API - Records as well.
In this case, in addition to the five OGC API - Records requirement classes mentioned in the <<collections-api-records,Collections requirements class>>, the implementation should verify and declare conformance with these additional two conformance classes defined in Records corresponding to the following URIs:
