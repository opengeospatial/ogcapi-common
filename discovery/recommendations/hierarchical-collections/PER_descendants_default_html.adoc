identifier:: /per/hierarchical-collections/descendants-default-html
part:: For representations not intended primarily for consumption by machines, such as an HTML representation, an implementation MAY assume a default value of `immediate` for the `descendants` query parameter, so as to present the collections in a hierarchical manner and avoid an unnecessarily large response when a large number of collections are available.
