description: |-
  The extent of the data in the collection. In the Core only spatial and temporal
  extents are specified. Extensions may add additional members to represent other
  extents, for example, thermal or pressure ranges.

  The first item in the array describes the overall extent of
  the data. All subsequent items describe more precise extents,
  e.g., to identify clusters of data.
  Clients only interested in the overall extent will only need to
  access the first item in each array.

      bbox:
        description: |-
          One or more bounding boxes that describe the spatial extent of the dataset.

          The first bounding box describes the overall spatial
          extent of the data. All subsequent bounding boxes describe
          more precise bounding boxes, e.g., to identify clusters of data.
          Clients only interested in the overall spatial extent will
          only need to access the first item in each array.

        items:
          description: |-
            Each bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on
            whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis
            (height or depth):

            * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
            * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
            * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
            * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
            * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
            * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

            If the value consists of four numbers, the coordinate reference system is
            WGS 84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84)
            unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in `crs` property.

            If the value consists of six numbers, the coordinate reference system is WGS 84
            longitude/latitude/ellipsoidal height (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h)
            unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in `crs` property.

            For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
            minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
            However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
            (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

            If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
            the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

            If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
            server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
            the extent or all relevant geometries.
