title: Extent with Uniform Additional Dimensions Schema
description: |-
  The extent module only addresses spatial and temporal extents. This module extends extent by specifying how
  intervals and crs properties can be used to specify additional geometries.
allOf:
  - $ref: 'extent.yaml'
  - type: object
    additionalProperties:
       description: |-
         The domain intervals for any additional dimensions of the extent (envelope) beyond those described in temporal and spatial.
       type: object
       oneOf:
         - required: [ interval, definition ]
         - required: [ interval, trs ]
         - required: [ interval, vrs ]
       properties:
         interval:
           description: |-
             One or more intervals that describe the extent for this dimension of the dataset.
             The value `null` is supported and indicates an unbounded or half-bounded interval.
             The first interval describes the overall extent of the data for this dimension.
             All subsequent intervals describe more precise intervals, e.g., to identify clusters of data.
             Clients only interested in the overall extent will only need
             to access the first item (a pair of lower and upper bound values).
           type: array
           minItems: 1
           items:
             description: |-
               Lower and upper bound values of the interval. The values
               are in the coordinate reference system specified in `crs`, `trs` or `vrs`.

         grid:
           type: object
           description: |-
             Provides information about the limited availability of data within the collection organized as a grid (regular or irregular) along the dimension.
           properties:
             coordinates:
               description: |-
                 List of coordinates along the temporal dimension for which data organized as an irregular grid in the collection is available
                 (e.g., 2, 10, 80, 100).

             cellsCount:
               description: |-
                 Number of samples available along the dimension for data organized as a regular grid.
                 For values representing the whole area of contiguous cells spanning _resolution_ units along the dimension, this will be (_upperBound_ - _lowerBound_) / _resolution_.
                 For values representing infinitely small point cells spaced by _resolution_ units along the dimension, this will be (_upperBound_ - _lowerBound_) / _resolution_ + 1.
