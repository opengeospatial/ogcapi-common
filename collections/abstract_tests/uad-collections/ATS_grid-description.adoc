For each dimension of the extents, including `spatial` and `temporal` as well as additional dimensions:

. If the data is known or described as being organized according to a specific regular or irregular grid, validate that the dimension property includes a `grid` property.
. If the data is known or described as being organized according to a regular grid, validate that the `grid` property validates against https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common/blob/master/collections/openapi/schemas/common-geodata/regularGrid.yaml[regularGrid.yaml]
. If the data is known or described as being organized according to an irregular grid, validate that the `grid` property validates against https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogcapi-common/blob/master/collections/openapi/schemas/common-geodata/regularGrid.yaml[irregularGrid.yaml]

NOTE: The `grid` property can be included whether an Implementation conforms to Uniform Additional Dimensions or not, but grid description is mandatory for gridded data when conforming to this Conformance Class.
