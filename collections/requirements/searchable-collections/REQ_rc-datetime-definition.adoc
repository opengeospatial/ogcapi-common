^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/collections/rc-datetime-definition*
^|A |The `datetime` parameter SHALL have the following characteristics (using an OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment):

[source,YAML]
----
name: datetime
in: query
required: false
schema:
  type: string
style: form
explode: false
----

^|B |Temporal geometries are either a date-time value or a time interval. The parameter value SHALL conform to the following syntax (using link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234[ABNF]):

[source]
----
interval-bounded            = date-time "/" date-time
interval-half-bounded-start = [".."] "/" date-time
interval-half-bounded-end   = date-time "/" [".."]
interval                    = interval-bounded / interval-half-bounded-start / interval-half-bounded-end
datetime                    = date-time / interval
----
^|C |Server implementations SHALL interpret the `date-time` as specified by link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6[RFC 3339, 5.6] supporting at least UTC time with the notation ending with a Z (with support for local time offsets optional).
^|D |When a double-dot (`..`) or an empty string is specified in a time interval, the implementation SHALL interpret it as a half-bounded or an unbounded interval (open range).
