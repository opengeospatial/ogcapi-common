^|*Permission {counter:per-id}* |*/per/collections/rc-md-extent-extensions*
^|A |API-Common only specifies requirements for spatial and temporal extents. However, the `extent` object MAY be extended with additional members to represent other extents, such as thermal or pressure ranges.
^|B |API-Common only supports 

* Spatial extents in CRS84 or CRS84h and 
* Temporal extents in the Gregorian calendar

These are the only _enum_ values in link:http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/common/part2/1.0/schemas/extent.yaml[extent.yaml]).
^|C |Extensions MAY add additional reference systems to the `extent` object.
