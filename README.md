# OGC API (OAPI) Common Specification

[OGC](http://opengeospatial.org) API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs. The OGC API family of standards is organized by resource type. Each resource has an associated API standard. These resource-specific API standards share a common core. This OGC API Common standard specifies requirements which are shared by all OGC API standards. The OGC API Common standard is maintained on this GitHub repository.

It is the goal of the OGC to produce standards which are concise, complete, and testable. However, such documents do not fully capture the body of knowledge needed to successfully implement the standard. API-Common provides this non-normative information through the associated Best Practices document. The standard tells you what you must do. The Best Practices tell you how and why.

This standard is available in [HTML](https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=91125) and [PDF](https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=91124) formats.

The Best Practices are available in [HTML](https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/October-2019-Update/19-072BP.html) and [PDF](https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/October-2019-Update/19-072BP.pdf) formats.

## Draft Spec
